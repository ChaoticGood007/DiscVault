## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Multi-Edit Inventory**: Added the ability to select multiple discs in the inventory table and bulk edit their properties (`inBag`, `condition`, `weight`, `plastic`, and `location`) natively inside a new `BulkEditModal`.
- **Bulk Update Actions**: Expanded `inventory.ts` server actions with `bulkUpdateInventory` to safely perform partial batched database queries.

### Fixed
- **Table Sorting Navigation**: Resolved a bug where clicking a column header to sort the inventory table would forcefully lose the current Vault context and redirect back to the app root menu. The URL builder now smartly utilizes `usePathname()` to construct relative URLs.
